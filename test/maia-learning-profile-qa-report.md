## Section 6: Recommendations

### 6.1 Critical Fixes (Must Address)

**NONE IDENTIFIED**

---

### 6.2 High-Priority Improvements (Should Address)

#### **Issue 1: Missing Co-Founder Information**

**Location:** Line 28 (CEO/Founder section) and Lines 350-373 (Key Personnel)

**Current State:**
```markdown
**CEO/Founder:** Satish Mirle
```

**Issue:** Profile lists only Satish Mirle as founder, but Dewan Zeng is confirmed as Co-Founder and CFO

**Evidence:**
- Crunchbase: "Founders: Dewan Zeng, Satish Mirle"
- Crunchbase: "Dewan Zeng: Co-Founder, Chief Financial Officer"
- Multiple search results confirm Dewan Zeng as Co-Founder & CFO

**Recommendation:**

Update Line 28:
```markdown
**Founders:** Satish Mirle (CEO), Dewan Zeng (CFO)
```

Add to Key Personnel section (after Line 358):
```markdown
**Dewan Zeng - Co-Founder & CFO**
- Co-founded company with Satish Mirle
- Oversees financial operations
- [Additional background if available]
```

**Priority:** 🟡 **HIGH** - Co-founder information is important for comprehensive company understanding

**Estimated Fix Time:** 5 minutes

---

### 6.3 Medium-Priority Improvements (Consider Addressing)

#### **Issue 2: Founding Date Clarification Needed**

**Location:** Line 26 (Founded) and Line 244 (Timeline)

**Current State:**
```markdown
**Founded:** 2010
...
**2010:** Company founded by Satish Mirle
```

**Issue:** Corporate entity (Serviceinfinity, Inc.) incorporated 2008, but MaiaLearning brand/product launched ~2010. Profile doesn't explain this.

**Evidence:**
- Crunchbase: "Serviceinfinity, Inc. was incorporated in 2008 and is based in Palo Alto, California"
- Web search: Multiple sources show both 2008 (Serviceinfinity) and 2010 (MaiaLearning)
- About page focuses on MaiaLearning story starting 2010

**Recommendation:**

Update Line 26:
```markdown
**Founded:** 2010 (as MaiaLearning; corporate entity Serviceinfinity, Inc. established 2008)
```

Or add clarification to Founding Story section (Line 37):
```markdown
CEO Satish Mirle and CFO Dewan Zeng founded the company (originally incorporated as Serviceinfinity, Inc. in 2008, rebranded to MaiaLearning in 2010) after experiencing frustrations with existing platforms during college application processes. They wanted to create a modern, engaging experience with best-in-class service.
```

**Priority:** 🟡 **MEDIUM** - Clarifies company history, reduces potential confusion

**Estimated Fix Time:** 3 minutes

---

#### **Issue 3: Common App Integration Timing Could Be More Specific**

**Location:** Line 67, Line 252

**Current State:**
```markdown
**3. Applying to College**
- Common App integration (since 2018)
...
**2018:**
- Common App integration partnership (early adopter)
```

**Issue:** Partnership announced Sept 2018, but integration actually went live Aug 2019. Profile is technically correct but could be clearer.

**Evidence:**
- Sept 2018: Partnership announcement
- Aug 2019: Integration went live
- Press releases confirm both dates

**Recommendation:**

Update Line 67:
```markdown
- Common App integration (partnership 2018, launched 2019)
```

Update Line 252:
```markdown
**2018:**
- Common App integration partnership announced (early adopter)
- Integration went live in 2019
```

**Priority:** 🟢 **LOW-MEDIUM** - Adds precision but current version not incorrect

**Estimated Fix Time:** 2 minutes

---

### 6.4 Optional Enhancements (Nice to Have)

#### **Enhancement 1: Add Inside Higher Ed Article Details**

**Current:** Line 262 mentions article but no specific details

**Suggestion:** Add quote or key finding from March 2023 article:
```markdown
**2023:**
- Featured in Inside Higher Ed (March 12, 2023): "Companies offer new competition to Naviance"
- Noted as adding 150-200 high schools annually, total of 1,000+ high schools outside California
- Recognized alongside SCOIR as gaining market share against Naviance
```

**Priority:** 🟢 **LOW** - Adds context but current version acceptable

---

#### **Enhancement 2: Add Market Share Context**

**Current:** No market share information

**Suggestion:** Add to Competitive Positioning section:
```markdown
**Market Position Context (2023):**
- 1,000+ U.S. high schools (outside California state contract)
- Adding 150-200 high schools annually (Inside Higher Ed, March 2023)
- Smaller than market leader Naviance but growing steadily
- Strong international presence differentiates from US-focused competitors
```

**Priority:** 🟢 **LOW** - Nice context but not essential for baseline profile
