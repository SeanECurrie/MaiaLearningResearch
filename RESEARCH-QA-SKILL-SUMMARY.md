# Research Quality Assurance Skill - Summary

**Created:** November 17, 2025  
**Companion Skill:** competitive-research-brightdata  
**Purpose:** Systematic fact-checking, source verification, and quality assurance for research deliverables

---

## Overview

I've created a comprehensive **Research Quality Assurance** skill that works as a companion to your competitive-research-brightdata skill. This skill provides systematic fact-checking, source verification, and quality assessment methodologies to ensure your research deliverables meet enterprise consulting standards before delivery to clients.

---

## How It Works

### This is a Separate, Optional Skill

**This skill does NOT automatically trigger.** You must explicitly request QA/review when YOU want it.

**Example Optional Workflow (when you choose to use QA):**

1. **Research Phase** - Use competitive-research-brightdata to create profiles and analyses
2. **QA Phase (OPTIONAL)** - When YOU request it: "Review the Naviance profile"
3. **Revision Phase (if needed)** - Fix any issues found
4. **Final Check (OPTIONAL)** - If YOU want: "Quick validation of fixes"
5. **Delivery** - You decide when it's ready

**You control when/if QA happens. The skill only activates when you explicitly ask for review.**

### When to Use This Skill

✅ Review completed research before client delivery  
✅ Fact-check specific claims that seem uncertain  
✅ Validate sources and citations  
✅ Check consistency across multiple documents  
✅ Assess quality against consulting standards  
✅ Pre-delivery QA audit  

❌ Not for initial research (use competitive-research-brightdata)  
❌ Not for generating new findings  
❌ Not for strategic recommendations

## Skill Capabilities

### 1. Fact-Checking

**Verifies:**
- Company information (founded dates, CEO names, headquarters)
- Market data (market share, customer counts, geographic presence)
- Product features (availability, integrations, launch dates)
- Pricing claims (costs, comparisons, transparency)
- Customer reviews (ratings, testimonial accuracy)
- News items (acquisitions, funding, recent developments)

**Methods:**
- Web search to verify claims
- Bright Data tools for deeper verification
- Multiple source triangulation (2-3 independent sources)
- Primary source prioritization (company sites, official reports)
- Cross-referencing with original research sources

### 2. Source Validation

**Checks:**
- URL accessibility (no broken links)
- Content accuracy (source actually says what's claimed)
- Date currency (information recent and relevant)
- Author credibility (source authoritative)
- Context accuracy (quotes not out of context)

**Documents:**
- ✅ Verified: Source confirms claim
- ⚠️ Partially Verified: Source supports with caveats
- ❌ Not Verified: Source doesn't support claim
- 🔗 Broken: URL inaccessible or content changed
- 📅 Outdated: Source too old or superseded

### 3. Consistency Analysis

**Reviews:**
- Internal consistency (within documents)
- Cross-document consistency (across profiles, analyses)
- Numerical consistency (calculations correct, numbers align)
- Timeline verification (dates chronological and accurate)
- Terminology consistency (same concepts called same things)

### 4. Gap Identification

**Identifies:**
- Sparse citations (major claims with only 1-2 sources)
- Missing sources (assertions without evidence)
- Outdated information (old sources when recent available)
- Conflicting information (unresolved contradictions)
- Missing comparisons (incomplete competitive analysis)

### 5. Quality Assessment

**Evaluates Against:**
- McKinsey/BCG/Bain quality standards
- Consulting industry benchmarks
- Academic research standards
- Industry analyst report standards (Gartner, Forrester)

**Scores:**
- Evidence quality
- Analysis quality  
- Internal consistency
- Writing & presentation
- Overall quality score (0-100%)

## Best Practices for Using Both Skills Together

### Optional Workflow (You Control Each Step)

These are suggestions for when you CHOOSE to use QA, not automatic stages:

**Step 1: Do Your Research**
Use competitive-research-brightdata when you want to:
- Conduct research
- Create company profiles
- Build comparative analyses
- Generate strategic insights

**Step 2: Request QA (ONLY if you want it)**
Explicitly ask for review when YOU decide:
- "Review the Naviance profile"
- "Fact-check the pricing analysis"
- "Verify sources across all profiles"

The research-quality-assurance skill will:
- Verify factual claims
- Validate sources
- Check consistency
- Assess quality
- Generate QA report

**Step 3: Fix Issues (if QA found any)**
Continue using competitive-research-brightdata:
- Address issues from QA report
- Update documents

**Step 4: Final Check (ONLY if you want it)**
You can request:
- "Quick validation that I fixed the issues"
- Or skip this and deliver if you're confident

**Step 5: Deliver When YOU Decide It's Ready**

**Key Point:** You explicitly request each QA step. Nothing happens automatically.

### Communication Between Phases

**After QA Review:**
The QA report specifies exactly what needs fixing:
```
❌ ISSUE: Market Share Claim Unverified
WHERE: 02-SCOIR-profile.md, Executive Summary, Line 12
CLAIM: "SCOIR has 12% market share"
ISSUE: Only one source cited, no date, conflicts with other doc
EVIDENCE: Web search found 10-15% range
RECOMMENDATION: Add 2+ recent sources, use range if exact unknown
PRIORITY: High (in executive summary)
EST. TIME: 15 minutes
```

This makes revision efficient - you know exactly:
- What's wrong
- Where it is
- Why it's an issue
- What evidence was found
- How to fix it
- How important it is
- How long it will take

---

## Quality Standards Reference

### What Makes "Consulting-Grade" Quality?

**Evidence:**
- All major claims backed by 2-3 independent sources
- Primary sources prioritized (company sites, official data)
- Information recent (within 12 months for current data)
- Conflicts noted and explained
- Data gaps explicitly acknowledged

**Analysis:**
- Frameworks applied correctly
- Logical flow from evidence to conclusions
- Alternative explanations considered
- Limitations stated
- Recommendations specific and actionable

**Presentation:**
- Executive summary captures key findings (1-2 pages)
- Clear structure with logical flow
- Professional writing (concise, active voice)
- Data visualizations accurate and insightful
- Suitable for C-level presentation

**Quality Score Interpretation:**
- 95-100%: Outstanding, publication-grade
- 85-94%: Very good, client-ready with minor polish
- 75-84%: Good, generally client-ready
- 60-74%: Acceptable, improvements needed before delivery
- Below 60%: Needs major work, not client-ready

---

## Efficiency Tips

### Batch Similar Verifications
Instead of verifying claims one-by-one, group similar types:
- All founding dates together
- All market share claims together
- All pricing data together

This is more efficient because:
- Less tool switching
- Consistent verification method
- Easier to spot patterns
- Can use batch search operations

### Prioritize Critical Claims
Focus verification effort on:
1. Executive summary claims (highest visibility)
2. Strategic recommendations (highest impact)
3. Comparative claims (most scrutinized)
4. Recent news (most likely to be outdated)

Less critical (if time limited):
- Historical background
- Company founding stories
- Detailed feature descriptions

### Use Appropriate Review Depth
- **Quick Validation:** Before meetings, time-constrained
- **Standard Review:** Before client delivery, important internal
- **Comprehensive Audit:** High-stakes, publication, formal audits
- **Targeted:** Specific concerns or disputes

Don't over-invest in QA when quick validation sufficient.
