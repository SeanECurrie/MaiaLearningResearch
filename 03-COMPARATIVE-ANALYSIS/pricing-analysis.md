# Pricing Analysis - College & Career Readiness Platforms

**Created:** November 17, 2025
**Task:** Phase 3, Task 3.2 - Pricing Analysis
**Scope:** Comprehensive pricing comparison across 8 platforms

---

## Executive Summary

**Key Findings:**

1. **Maia's Pricing Challenge:** At ~$10/student, Maia is **2-3x more expensive** than most competitors
2. **Market Price Range:** $3.50-$6/student is the competitive sweet spot
3. **Pricing Transparency:** Wide variation from fully transparent (SCOIR) to completely opaque (Naviance)
4. **Premium Pricing:** Only Cialfo ($30) charges more than Maia, but has poor reviews (2.4/5)
5. **Disruptive Models:** Xello's statewide free-access (Florida, New Hampshire) sets dangerous precedent
6. **Strategic Imperative:** Maia must either justify premium OR adjust pricing to remain competitive

---

### MajorClarity - ~$5/student

**Pricing Model:**
- **Per-student** subscription
- Grades 6-12 coverage
- CTE-focused pricing

**Evidence:**
- **Estimated:** ~$5/student (competitive analyses, industry sources)
- **No public contracts** found (smaller customer base)
- Limited pricing transparency

**Post-Acquisition Impact:**
- Acquired by Edmentum (Oct 29, 2025)
- Pricing strategy uncertain post-acquisition

- CTE focus differentiates from comprehensive platforms

**Value Proposition:**
- "Career test-drives with proven 189% impact"
- "CTE-aligned for career readiness mandates"
- "Mid-range price for specialized features"

**Strategic Notes:**
- Recent acquisition creates pricing uncertainty
- May change pricing to match Edmentum ecosystem
- Limited brand recognition may pressure pricing down

---

### Naviance - $8-12/student (estimated)

**Pricing Model:**
- **Quote-based, highly opaque**
- Varies widely by district size, features, negotiations
- No published pricing whatsoever

**Evidence:**
- **Estimated range:** $8-12/student (competitive analyses, RFP data)
- **Generally most expensive** among major platforms
- PowerSchool acquisition (2021, $320M) hasn't lowered prices

**Pricing Opacity Issues:**
- **No transparency:** Zero published pricing
- **Inconsistent:** Same-size districts pay different amounts
- **Frustrating:** Consistent complaint in reviews (3.2/5 G2, 3.7/5 Capterra)
- **Barrier:** Requires demos, sales calls, lengthy negotiations

**Transparency:** ⭐ Very Low
- **Worst transparency** in industry
- Source of customer frustration
- Competitive vulnerability

**Competitive Position:**
- **Highest pricing** among comprehensive platforms (only Cialfo higher)
- 2-3x more expensive than Xello/SchooLinks/SCOIR
- Premium pricing justified by market dominance (40% share), not features

**Value Proposition (Weak):**
- "Market leader, most schools use us"
- "Comprehensive features, deep integrations"
- "PowerSchool backing, stability"

**Strategic Notes:**
- **Pricing is vulnerability:** Competitors attack Naviance's high cost
- **Opacity backfiring:** Customers frustrated, switching to transparent alternatives
- **Premium unjustified:** Features comparable to cheaper competitors
- **Switching opportunity:** SCOIR, SchooLinks, Maia target cost-conscious districts

---

### Maia Learning - ~$10/student

**Pricing Model:**
- **Per-student** subscription
- Evidence: $2,000 for 200 students = $10/student

**Pricing Range:**
- **Estimated:** $7-10/student depending on volume, contract length
- **Premium tier:** Possible enterprise pricing for large districts

**Transparency:** ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate
- Not published on website
- Quote-based but straightforward in sales process
- Some pricing data available through customer references

**Competitive Position:**
- **Second-highest pricing** (only Cialfo $30 is higher)
- **2-3x more expensive** than Xello ($3.60), SchooLinks ($3.50-5.51), SCOIR ($4.80)
- **Comparable to Naviance** ($8-12), but Maia lacks Naviance's market dominance excuse

**Current Value Proposition:**
- "International platform for global students (70+ countries)"
- "Deep multilingual localization, not just translation"
- "Built by counselors for counselors"
- "Exceptional customer service and support"
- "Comprehensive platform beyond single-focus competitors"

**CRITICAL ISSUE: Pricing Competitiveness**

**The Problem:**
- Maia costs **$10/student**
- SCOIR costs **$4.80-6** (50-55% less) with AI innovation
- Xello costs **$3.60** (64% less) with proven 14x engagement
- SchooLinks costs **$3.50-5.51** (45-65% less) with state compliance

**Customer Perspective:**
- "Why pay $10 for Maia when SCOIR is $5 with AI?"
- "Why pay $10 for Maia when Xello is $3.60 with career-first focus?"
- "Why pay $10 for Maia when SchooLinks is $4 with Texas CCMR compliance?"

**Scenarios Where Premium Pricing Works:**
1. **International schools:** Competitors weak internationally (Maia's 70+ countries unique)
2. **Multilingual districts:** Deep localization justifies premium (12+ languages, cultural adaptation)
3. **Counselor-centric schools:** Built-by-counselors value proposition resonates
4. **Service-focused buyers:** Legendary support worth the premium

**Scenarios Where Premium Pricing FAILS:**
1. **US domestic public schools:** Price-sensitive, SCOIR/SchooLinks/Xello compelling
2. **Budget-constrained districts:** 2-3x cost impossible to justify
3. **Feature-focused buyers:** AI (SCOIR), compliance (SchooLinks), career (Xello) beat Maia
4. **State contracts:** Xello's free-access model sets "free" expectation

---

### Cialfo - ~$30/student

**Pricing Model:**
- **Per-student** subscription
- **Highest pricing** in market

**Evidence:**
- **Estimated:** $25-35/student (industry sources, competitive analyses)
- **International premium:** Reflects global platform, multiple currencies
- **Three-sided platform:** Revenue from students, schools, AND universities

**Additional Revenue Streams:**
- University recruitment fees (access to student database)
- Direct Apply premium services
- International HS tour programs
- Institutional subscriptions

**Transparency:** ⭐⭐ Low
- No published pricing
- Quote-based
- Varies by region (Asia-Pacific vs. other markets)

**Competitive Position:**
- **Highest pricing** (3x Xello, 5-6x SchooLinks, 3x SCOIR, 3x Maia)
- Premium justified by unique features (Direct Apply to 75k programs)
- Asia-Pacific dominance supports premium

**CRITICAL WEAKNESS: Poor Reviews Undermine Pricing**
- **MouthShut:** 2.4/5 stars
- **AmbitionBox:** 2.5/5 stars
- **RepVue:** 1.0/5 stars
- **Conclusion:** Premium pricing NOT justified by customer satisfaction

**Value Proposition (Weak Given Reviews):**
- "Direct Apply to 75,000+ programs (unique)"
- "Three-sided network (students-schools-universities)"
- "Asia-Pacific market leader"
- "University recruitment platform"

**Strategic Opportunity for Maia:**
- Cialfo charges $30 with 2.4/5 satisfaction
- Maia charges $10 with superior service reputation
- **Target:** Dissatisfied Cialfo customers in Asia-Pacific
- **Message:** "Premium service at 1/3 the price"

---

### Common App - N/A (Nonprofit)

**Pricing Model:**
- **Free to students** (nonprofit mission)
- **Membership fees for colleges** (1,100+ member institutions)
- **NOT a competitor** to counseling platforms

**College Membership Tiers:**
- Tiered membership based on institution size, type
- Annual membership fees fund operations
- No per-application fees for students

**Relevance to Pricing Analysis:**
- Sets "free application" expectation
- Platforms must integrate (no direct pricing competition)
- Integration quality is competitive differentiator, not price

## 3. Pricing Transparency Comparison

| Platform | Transparency Level | Published Pricing | Contract Data | Customer Impact |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|
| **SCOIR** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very High | ✅ Ranges available | ✅ Some public | Positive (clear expectations) |
| **Xello** | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate | ⚠️ Some contracts | ✅ Public contracts | Neutral (findable with effort) |
| **Maia** | ⭐⭐⭐ Moderate | ❌ No | ⚠️ Limited | Neutral (straightforward process) |
| **MajorClarity** | ⭐⭐ Low | ❌ No | ❌ Minimal | Frustrating (opaque) |
| **SchooLinks** | ⭐⭐ Low | ❌ No | ✅ Large districts | Frustrating (inconsistent) |
| **Cialfo** | ⭐⭐ Low | ❌ No | ❌ Minimal | Frustrating (premium opaque) |
| **Naviance** | ⭐ Very Low | ❌ No | ⚠️ Some leaks | Very frustrating (worst opacity) |

**Insights:**
- **SCOIR's transparency** is competitive weapon (customers appreciate clarity)
- **Naviance's opacity** is vulnerability (consistent complaint in reviews)
- **Maia's moderate transparency** is competitive (better than Naviance, worse than SCOIR)
- **Recommendation:** Consider publishing price ranges (SCOIR model) to differentiate from Naviance

---

## 4. Business Models & Pricing Strategies

### Per-Student Subscription (Most Common)

**Used By:** Maia, Naviance, SCOIR, SchooLinks, Xello, Cialfo, MajorClarity

**Model:**
- Annual subscription per enrolled student
- Recurring revenue, predictable cash flow
- Volume discounts for larger districts
- Multi-year contracts common (3-5 years)

**Advantages:**
- Scales with student enrollment
- Fair (pay for what you use)
- Predictable budgeting for districts
- Recurring revenue for vendors

**Disadvantages:**
- Enrollment fluctuations impact revenue
- Small schools pay same per-student as large (no economies of scale)
- Churn risk if students leave district

**Pricing Factors:**
- District size (larger = lower per-student rate)
- Contract length (multi-year = discount)
- Feature selection (basic vs. premium)
- Geographic market (urban vs. rural, state funding)
- Competitive landscape (match or beat alternatives)

---

### Statewide Partnership (Emerging Model)

**Used By:** Xello (Florida K-12, New Hampshire HS)

**Model:**
- State department of education contracts for entire state
- Free access for all schools/students
- Massive scale, brand presence
- Sticky (hard to replace once statewide)

**Advantages (Vendor):**
- Huge scale (millions of students)
- Brand validation (state endorsement)
- Market penetration (entire state)
- Competitive moat (switching costs high)

**Advantages (State/Districts):**
- Free for districts (state-funded)
- Equity (all students get access)
- Standardization (one platform statewide)
- Compliance (state requirements met)

**Threat to Competitors:**
- Sets "free" expectation
- Crowds out competitors in entire state
- Price pressure (how do you compete with free?)

**Maia Implications:**
- Xello's FL/NH contracts prove model viability
- Maia should pursue state partnerships (counter Xello)
- Discounted statewide pricing essential
- Target states: California, Texas, New York (large, diverse, international)

---

### Three-Sided Platform (Cialfo)

**Used By:** Cialfo (students-schools-universities)

**Model:**
- Revenue from students/schools (subscriptions)
- Revenue from universities (recruitment access)
- Network effects (more users = more value)

**Additional Revenue:**
- University database access fees
- Direct Apply premium services
- International HS tour programs
- Recruitment marketing

**Advantages:**
- Diversified revenue streams
- Higher total revenue per user
- Network effects create moat
- Universities subsidize student costs (potentially)

**Challenges:**
- Complex business model
- Multiple customer types to serve
- Conflicts of interest (best college for student vs. recruitment revenue)

**Maia Implications:**
- Could explore university recruitment revenue
- College fairs, virtual tours could generate fees
- Must maintain neutrality (counselor trust critical)

---

### Freemium / Free Tier (Not Currently Used)

**Used By:** None in this market (potential future model)

**Model:**
- Basic features free
- Premium features paid
- Upsell from free to paid

**Examples (Other EdTech):**
- Khan Academy (free content, paid services)
- Duolingo (free app, paid premium)

**Potential for CCR Market:**
- **Free tier:** Basic college search, course planning
- **Paid tier:** AI features, counselor tools, application tracking, WBL
- **Enterprise tier:** District dashboards, compliance, integrations

**Advantages:**
- Lowers barrier to entry
- Viral growth potential
- Counters "free" statewide models
- Builds user base

**Challenges:**
- Free users cost money (support, infrastructure)
- Conversion rates uncertain (edu buyers conservative)
- May cannibalize existing revenue

**Maia Implications:**
- Consider freemium to counter Xello's free statewide
- Free tier for career exploration, paid for college planning
- Could differentiate from quote-based competitors

- **45-65% less:** SchooLinks ($3.50-5.51)
- **50-55% less:** SCOIR ($4.80-6)
- **50% less:** MajorClarity ($5)
- **Comparable:** Naviance ($8-12)
- **67% more:** Cialfo ($30)

### Where Maia's Premium IS Justified

**1. International Schools**
- **Maia advantage:** 70+ countries (unique), 12+ languages (deep localization)
- **Competitor weakness:** Xello (North America only), SchooLinks (US-only), SCOIR (US-focused)
- **Premium justification:** ✅ STRONG - no comparable alternative
- **Pricing power:** Can maintain $10+ for international market
- **Strategy:** Defend this segment, emphasize global reach

**2. Multilingual Districts**
- **Maia advantage:** Deep localization (cultural adaptation, local content)
- **Competitor weakness:** Xello (130 languages but AI translation, not localization)
- **Premium justification:** ✅ MODERATE - quality over quantity
- **Pricing power:** $8-10 sustainable for truly multilingual needs
- **Strategy:** Emphasize localization depth vs. translation breadth

**3. Service-Focused Buyers**
- **Maia advantage:** Legendary customer service, counselor community
- **Competitor weakness:** Naviance (poor 3.2/5 support rating)
- **Premium justification:** ✅ MODERATE - service quality valued
- **Pricing power:** $8-10 for white-glove support
- **Strategy:** Compete on service vs. Naviance's poor support

**4. Comprehensive Platform Buyers**
- **Maia advantage:** Breadth (not single-focus like Xello career-only)
- **Competitor weakness:** Xello (career-first), SCOIR (college AI-focused)
- **Premium justification:** ⚠️ WEAK - comprehensive is table stakes now
- **Pricing power:** Limited ($7-9 max)
- **Strategy:** Differentiate on unique features, not comprehensiveness

### Where Maia's Premium IS NOT Justified

**1. US Domestic Public Schools (Price-Sensitive)**
- **Competitor advantage:** SCOIR ($5), Xello ($3.60), SchooLinks ($4)
- **Maia disadvantage:** 2-3x more expensive with comparable features
- **Premium justification:** ❌ FAILED - can't justify 2-3x cost
- **Lost sales:** Likely losing RFPs on price alone
- **Strategy:** Adjust pricing OR exit this segment

**2. Feature-Focused Buyers (AI, Compliance, Career)**
- **Competitor advantage:**
  - AI: SCOIR (Scoir AI 2.0), SchooLinks (Agentic Layer)
  - Compliance: SchooLinks (Texas CCMR automation)
  - Career: Xello (28-year leader, 14x engagement)
- **Maia disadvantage:** Higher price, weaker specialized features
- **Premium justification:** ❌ FAILED - competitors offer more for less
- **Lost sales:** Losing to feature-superior, lower-cost alternatives
- **Strategy:** Close feature gaps (AI, compliance) OR price competitively

**3. State Contracts**
- **Competitor advantage:** Xello (FL free, NH free statewide)
- **Maia disadvantage:** $10/student can't compete with free
- **Premium justification:** ❌ FAILED - free always wins
- **Lost opportunities:** Entire states locked out
- **Strategy:** Develop state partnership pricing (discounted/free model)

**4. Budget-Constrained Districts**
- **Competitor advantage:** Any platform $3.60-6 (50-64% savings)
- **Maia disadvantage:** Unaffordable premium
- **Premium justification:** ❌ FAILED - budget constraints absolute
- **Lost sales:** Price eliminates Maia from consideration
- **Strategy:** Create budget-friendly tier OR exit segment

---

## 7. Competitive Pricing Strategies Observed

### SCOIR's Strategy: "Transparent Value"

**Approach:**
- Publish pricing ranges ($4.80-6)
- Straightforward, no surprises
- Mid-market pricing (not cheapest, not most expensive)

**Rationale:**
- Attack Naviance's opacity vulnerability
- Build trust with transparency
- Justify premium over Xello/SchooLinks with innovation (Scoir AI)

**Results:**
- 12% market share
- 40-50% annual growth
- High customer satisfaction (4.5-4.8/5)

**Lesson for Maia:**
- Consider publishing price ranges (differentiate from Naviance)
- Mid-market pricing ($6-8) could be sweet spot
- Transparency builds trust

---

### Xello's Strategy: "Value Leader"

**Approach:**
- Lowest price ($3.60)
- Statewide free-access partnerships
- Volume over margin

**Rationale:**
- Compete with Naviance on value (features + price)
- Statewide contracts = massive scale
- 28-year history provides credibility despite low price

**Results:**
- 20,000+ institutions
- 9M+ students
- Florida, New Hampshire statewide contracts

**Lesson for Maia:**
- Low price + scale = powerful combination
- Statewide partnerships are future of market
- Maia can't compete on price (3x higher) without value justification

---

### SchooLinks' Strategy: "Aggressive Growth"

**Approach:**
- Very low pricing ($3.50-5.51)
- Use $88.3M funding to buy market share
- Growth prioritized over profitability

**Rationale:**
- Attack Naviance from below (half the price)
- Win large districts (Chicago, Houston, Dallas, LA)
- State compliance features justify slight premium over Xello

**Results:**
- Inc. 5000 three years running
- Hundreds of thousands of students
- 14+ states → 50

**Lesson for Maia:**
- Well-funded competitors can undercut on price
- SchooLinks pricing ($4) sets market expectation
- Maia needs funding OR differentiation to compete

---

### Naviance's Strategy: "Market Leader Premium"

**Approach:**
- Highest pricing ($8-12)
- Quote-based opacity
- Leverage 40% market share

**Rationale:**
- Market leader can charge premium
- Network effects (colleges recruit via Naviance)
- PowerSchool backing provides stability

**Results:**
- 40% market share (dominant)
- BUT: Losing ground to SCOIR, SchooLinks (price/value)
- Poor support reviews undermine premium

**Lesson for Maia:**
- Premium pricing requires market dominance OR unique value
- Opacity is vulnerability (not strategy)
- Maia lacks Naviance's scale to justify premium

---

### Cialfo's Strategy: "International Premium" (FAILING)

**Approach:**
- Highest pricing ($30)
- International market focus
- Three-sided platform (students-schools-universities)

**Rationale:**
- International schools less price-sensitive
- Unique Direct Apply feature justifies premium
- University recruitment revenue supplements

**Results:**
- **FAILED:** Poor reviews (2.4/5, 2.5/5, 1.0/5)
- Premium NOT justified by customer satisfaction
- Vulnerable to competitors with better service

**Lesson for Maia:**
- High price REQUIRES high satisfaction
- Cialfo's failure creates switching opportunity
- Maia can charge premium IF service/value delivered

---

## 8. Pricing Strategy Options for Maia

### Option 1: Maintain Premium, Justify Rigorously

**Pricing:** Keep $9-10/student

**Target Segments:**
- International schools (Maia's strength)
- Multilingual districts (deep localization)
- Service-focused buyers (legendary support)
- Private schools (less price-sensitive)

**Value Justification Required:**
- ✅ 70+ countries (unique)
- ✅ 12+ deep languages (vs. AI translation)
- ✅ Counselor-centric design
- ✅ Legendary customer service
- ⚠️ AI letter writing (unique but niche)
- ❌ Comprehensive platform (table stakes)

**Risks:**
- Lose US domestic public schools to SCOIR/SchooLinks/Xello
- Continued price pressure as competitors improve
- Limited growth (premium segments smaller)

**Mitigation:**
- Double down on international expansion
- Emphasize service quality
- Target Cialfo switchers (Maia = better value at $10 vs. $30)

**Recommendation:** ⭐⭐⭐ VIABLE for international niche

---

### Option 2: Mid-Market Pricing ($6-8/student)

**Pricing:** Reduce to $6-8/student (20-40% reduction)

**Target Segments:**
- US domestic public schools (now competitive with SCOIR)
- Budget-conscious international schools
- Districts evaluating Naviance alternatives
- Growth markets (more accessible)

**Competitive Position:**
- Price parity with SCOIR ($4.80-6), Naviance ($8-12)
- Still premium to Xello ($3.60), SchooLinks ($3.50-5.51)
- Justifiable with international, service, comprehensive features

**Advantages:**
- Opens US domestic market (currently priced out)
- Competitive in RFPs (price no longer eliminator)
- Faster growth potential
- Attacks Naviance's overpricing

**Disadvantages:**
- 20-40% revenue reduction per customer
- Must increase volume to offset
- May commoditize Maia's premium positioning

**Requirements:**
- Maintain service quality (don't cut support)
- Emphasize value (Maia = SCOIR features + international + service)
- Transparent pricing (publish $6-8 range like SCOIR)

**Recommendation:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ STRONG option for growth

---

### Option 3: Tiered Pricing Model

**Pricing:**
- **Basic:** $5-6/student (core features, compete with SCOIR/SchooLinks)

---

### Recommendation #2: Increase Pricing Transparency ⭐⭐⭐⭐

- Clear packaging (features listed per tier)

**Rationale:**

- Naviance's opacity is vulnerability
- Builds trust, reduces sales friction
- Differentiates from quote-based competitors

**Implementation:**
- Add pricing page to website

- RFP responses (clear, upfront pricing)

---

### Recommendation #3: Develop State Partnership Pricing ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Action:**
- **Statewide discount:** $2-3/student for entire state
- **Free-access option:** State-funded, free to districts
- **Target states:** California, Texas, New York (counter Xello's FL/NH)

**Rationale:**
- Xello's statewide free-access is market threat
- Massive scale potential (millions of students)
- Competitive moat (hard to displace once statewide)

**Requirements:**
- State compliance features (Texas CCMR, California A-G, etc.)
- Scalability (infrastructure for millions)
- Government sales expertise (state procurement)

**Implementation:**

- **Emphasize unique value:** 70+ countries, 12+ deep languages, cultural localization
- **Target Cialfo switchers:** Maia = better value ($12 vs. $30, superior service)

**Rationale:**
- International is Maia's safe zone (competitors weak)
- Premium justified by unique features
- Cialfo's poor reviews (2.4/5) create opportunity

**Implementation:**
- International-focused marketing
- Cialfo comparison content ("Better service, half the price")

---

### Recommendation #5: Close Feature Gaps to Justify Pricing ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Action:**
- **Develop AI predictive analytics** (match SCOIR's Scoir AI)

- **Build state compliance features** (match SchooLinks' Texas CCMR)
- **Enhance career exploration** (narrow gap with Xello's 28-year lead)

**Rationale:**
- Can't justify premium without premium features
- SCOIR, SchooLinks, Xello have superior features at lower prices
- Feature parity enables pricing power

**Implementation:**
- Q1 2026: AI predictive chances (college acceptance)
- Q2 2026: Common App integration depth (match SCOIR)
- Q3 2026: Texas CCMR compliance dashboard
- Q4 2026: Career exploration enhancements

## 10. Pricing Competitive Intelligence

### Competitor Pricing Trends

**Downward Pressure:**
- Xello, SchooLinks aggressively pricing low ($3.50-3.60)
- VC-funded competitors (SchooLinks $88.3M) can sustain low margins
- Statewide free-access (Xello FL/NH) sets "free" expectation
- **Impact:** Maia's $10 looks increasingly expensive

**Transparency Trend:**
- SCOIR's published ranges (competitive advantage)
- Customers demand clarity (Naviance opacity backlash)
- RFP requirements (more pricing transparency required)
- **Impact:** Maia should publish ranges (match SCOIR)

**Tiered Models Emerging:**
- SCOIR likely has Basic/Plus tiers (inferred from $4.80-8 range)
- Freemium models possible (Khan Academy, Duolingo precedent)
- **Impact:** Maia should adopt tiered model (capture all segments)

**State Partnerships Growing:**
- Xello (Florida K-12, New Hampshire HS)
- SchooLinks (targeting state contracts)
- **Impact:** Maia MUST develop state partnership model

---

### Price Elasticity Insights

**Elastic Segments (Price-Sensitive):**
- US domestic public schools (budget-constrained)
- Small/rural districts (limited budgets)
- States with free alternatives (FL, NH have Xello free)
- **Implication:** Maia losing these segments at $10

**Inelastic Segments (Price-Insensitive):**
- International schools (no comparable alternatives)
- Private schools (less budget pressure)
- Wealthy districts (can afford premium)
- Service-focused buyers (value quality support)
- **Implication:** Maia can maintain premium in these segments

**Switching Thresholds:**
- **2x price difference** = strong switching motivation
- **3x price difference** = Maia eliminated from consideration
- **Current:** Maia 2-3x more than Xello/SchooLinks (high switching risk)
