# 05-ITERATIONS

## Purpose
Documentation of each major iteration/revision cycle, preserving context and decisions.

## Contents
- `iteration-1-initial-research/` - Initial research and V0.9 creation
- `iteration-2-qa-corrections/` - QA fixes and V1.0 creation
- `iteration-3-tim-revisions/` - Tim's strategic revisions and V2.0 creation

## Iteration Documentation Pattern
Each iteration folder should contain:
- `NOTES.md` - Summary of the iteration
- `requirements.md` - Clear requirements from client/stakeholder
- `plan.md` - Implementation plan (or link to `docs/plans/`)
- `changes.md` - List of changes made
- `lessons-learned.md` - What worked, what to improve

## When to Use
- When receiving client feedback
- When making strategic changes
- When tracking history of decisions
- For understanding why changes were made
