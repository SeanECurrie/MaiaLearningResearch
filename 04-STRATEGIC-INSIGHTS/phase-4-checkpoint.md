### Key Insights & Findings

**Top 10 Strategic Insights from Phase 4:**

1. **SCOIR is highest priority threat** (AI 2.0, Common App 2025-26, 40-50% growth) - Maia must close AI gap within 6 months or lose US private school market

2. **Pricing gap is critical barrier** (Maia $10 vs. $3.50-6 competitors) - Tiered pricing expands addressable market 3-5x while maintaining premium tier

3. **International moat is defensible** (70+ countries unique, all 4 US competitors US-only) - Maia's safe zone with minimal competition

4. **Naviance switcher opportunity is time-sensitive** (poor 3.2/5 reviews, 40% share declining) - Window to win 40-80 schools before Naviance improves or SCOIR captures all switchers

5. **Native mobile app is white space** (NO competitor has) - 12-18 month first-mover window before SCOIR launches

6. **AI is becoming table stakes** (within 12-18 months) - Platforms without advanced AI will be perceived as "legacy"

7. **Direct Admissions is table stakes** (200+ colleges 2025-26, 500+ by 2028) - Must support by 2026-27 or lose relevance

8. **Career exploration depth gap** (Xello 28-year leader, 14x engagement) - AI Career Coach can compete while leveraging AI 2.0 infrastructure

9. **"International Innovation Leader" positioning** - Unique category combining global reach (70+ countries) + innovation leadership (AI, mobile, pricing flexibility)

10. **Investment ROI is compelling** ($1.5-2.85M → 40-80% ROI Year 1, $2-4M ARR growth) - Financial case for strategic recommendations is strong
