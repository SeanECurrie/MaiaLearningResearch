**Purpose:** Document methodology decisions and adjustments made throughout the project.

## Initial Methodology Decisions (11-16-2024)

### Research Approach: Balanced Coverage
**Decision:** Use 8-10 tool calls per competitor for initial research pass

**Rationale:**
- Allows complete coverage of all 7 competitors
- Provides sufficient depth for initial analysis
- More efficient than deep-dive approach (15-20 calls per company)
- Enables identification of areas needing deeper investigation
- Can always circle back for focused deep dives

**Alternative Considered:** Deep dive on each competitor (15-20 calls)
**Why Not:** Would take too long, might gather unnecessary detail, less flexible

### Iteration Strategy: Broad Then Narrow
**Decision:** Complete broad initial pass across all competitors, then targeted deep dives

**Rationale:**
- Can't identify what needs deeper investigation until we see all competitors
- Broad view enables better prioritization of deep dive topics
- More efficient use of research time
- Allows for dynamic adjustment based on findings

### Source Priority: Primary Over Secondary
**Decision:** Prioritize official company sources, then industry sources, then reviews

**Quality Hierarchy:**
1. Company official websites, press releases, documentation
2. Industry analyst reports, news from reputable publications
3. Review sites, forums, social media (for validation only)

### Recency Standards
- Prioritize 2024-2025 information
