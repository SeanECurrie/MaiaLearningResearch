AI-powered platform (Saige AI). Pricing ~$30/student. Integrations: Common App, UCAS, Parchment. CRITICAL WEAKNESS: Very poor customer reviews across multiple platforms (MouthShut 2.4/5, AmbitionBox 2.5/5, RepVue 1.0/5) - creates MAJOR switching opportunity.

Richmond, VA based. Unfunded/bootstrapped until acquisitions. CTE-focused career & college readiness platform. Unique career "test-drives" with 189% proven impact on career-aligned planning. 50% student usage rates (3x industry average). Now part of Edmentum's end-to-end solution: discovery + planning + 180+ CTE courses + 57 pathways + certification prep. Pricing ~$5/student (mid-range, competitive with Maia). Grades 6-12 coverage, micro-credentials, work-based learning tracking, 70+ educator lesson plans. CRITICAL: Limited brand recognition (NOT mentioned in industry analyses naming SCOIR and Maia as top Naviance competitors). Minimal customer review data (unlike other competitors). US-only market (vs. Maia's 70+ countries). Recent acquisition creates integration uncertainty. LOW-MEDIUM threat to Maia: Direct competition minimal (different markets—MajorClarity = US CTE public schools, Maia = international/college-prep). Maia safe zones: International, multilingual, private schools, college counseling. MajorClarity advantages: Edmentum backing, CTE integration, career test-drives, scalability.

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Completed:** 11-16-2025
**Time Spent:** 1.5h
**Summary:** Comprehensive Common App organization profile complete (~10,000 words). KEY INSIGHT: Common App is NOT a competitor to Maia—it's essential infrastructure/ecosystem partner. Founded 1975 (50 years old, celebrating golden anniversary), 1,100+ member colleges, 1.5M applicants 2024-25 (5% growth). CRITICAL FINDINGS: (1) SCOIR's NEW 2025-26 Common App integration is major competitive advantage—Maia MUST verify integration depth vs. SCOIR/Naviance, (2) Direct Admissions program (200+ colleges 2025-26) is disruptive innovation requiring platform adaptation, (3) Coalition App is smaller alternative (~150 colleges vs. 1,100+). Integration quality is competitive differentiator: Naviance has legacy deep integration, SCOIR has NEW integration with co-marketing, Maia must achieve parity. Direct Admissions shifts value from "help apply" to "help choose wisely"—requires new features (offer comparison, financial aid evaluation, strategic guidance). NOT a threat assessment (not a competitor), but integration gap could cause schools to switch. Recommendations: (1) URGENT audit of Maia's Common App integration vs. competitors, (2) Build Direct Admissions support features, (3) Support Coalition App alternative (150 schools), (4) Monitor Common App developments closely. 50+ sources researched. **PHASE 2 DATA COLLECTION NOW 100% COMPLETE!**

Financial modeling: Tiered model = 264% growth over 5 years (best option), mid-market $7 = 203% growth, maintain $10 = 60% growth (limited). Six pricing strategy options analyzed with detailed pros/cons. Competitor pricing strategies documented (SCOIR transparent value, Xello value leader, SchooLinks aggressive growth, Naviance market leader premium failing, Cialfo international premium failing).

Key findings: (1) **Maia's Defensible Moat:** 70+ countries international presence is UNIQUE; 6 of 7 competitors are US-only; (2) **Biggest Threats:** SCOIR (🔴 VERY HIGH - innovation + 40-50% growth + AI 2.0 + Common App 2025-26), SchooLinks (🟡 MED-HIGH - $88.3M funding + pricing $3.50-5.51 + state compliance), Xello (🟡 MED-HIGH - career-first 28 years + statewide contracts FL/NH + pricing $3.60); (3) **Biggest Opportunities:** Cialfo poor reviews (2.4/5) = switching opportunity in Asia-Pacific, native mobile app (NO competitor has), AI/Common App gaps (close to neutralize SCOIR); (4) **Critical Vulnerabilities:** Pricing gap (Maia $10 vs. competitors $3.50-6 = 2-3x), AI capabilities lag (SCOIR AI 2.0, SchooLinks Agentic Layer ahead), Common App integration depth (SCOIR NEW 2025-26); (5) **Safe Zones:** International markets, private schools, multilingual schools, college-prep focus. Strategic priorities ranked in 3 tiers (URGENT next 6mo: Common App audit, predictive AI development, attack Cialfo APAC, defend international moat; HIGH next 12mo: native mobile app, pricing strategy, target Naviance switchers, enhance career exploration; MEDIUM 12-24mo: EdFi certification, WBL depth, K-5 maturation, state compliance). Comparative SWOT insights: Common strengths (funding, K-12 coverage, career focus, AI innovation), common weaknesses (US-only geography, limited multilingual, no native mobile apps, EdFi unknown), unique strengths by competitor identified. Threat Matrix and Opportunity Matrix created with color-coded priorities. Competitor clustering: US Market Leaders (Naviance vs. SCOIR battle), US Aggressive Growth (SchooLinks + Xello budget competition), International Players (Maia vs. Cialfo), Niche Players (MajorClarity CTE), Essential Infrastructure (Common App partner).

- [x] Map all 8 companies on dimensions
- [x] Identify strategic groups/clusters
- [x] Analyze white space opportunities
- [x] Create visual representation (text-based)

**Status:** ✅ Complete
**Completed:** 11-17-2025
**Dependencies:** Complete Phase 3 comparative analysis
**Estimated Time:** 1h
**Actual Time:** 1h
**Summary:** Comprehensive competitive positioning map complete (~12,500 words). Created 3 strategic positioning maps with different dimensions: (1) **Map 1: Innovation Leadership vs. Market Coverage** - Shows SCOIR/SchooLinks as innovation leaders racing to scale, Naviance/Xello as established players defending, Maia in balanced center position (high innovation + international coverage), white space in Q1 (high innovation + high market coverage); (2) **Map 2: Pricing Strategy vs. Geographic Scope** - Reveals Maia plays TWO DIFFERENT games: international value player ($10 vs. Cialfo $30) AND US premium player ($10 vs. SCOIR $5-6, SchooLinks $3.50-5.51), white space in Q2 (global reach + value pricing $3-5 = no player here); (3) **Map 3: Feature Specialization vs. Customer Satisfaction** - Shows Maia in Q1 gold standard position (comprehensive + high satisfaction), SCOIR in Q2 (specialist + high satisfaction) moving toward Q1, Naviance/Cialfo in Q4 most vulnerable (comprehensive + poor satisfaction 3.2/5 and 2.4/5). **5 Strategic Clusters Identified:** US Innovation Leaders (SCOIR 🔴, SchooLinks 🟡), US Established Players (Naviance 🟡, Xello 🟡), International Players (Maia ⭐, Cialfo 🟡), Niche Specialists (MajorClarity 🟢), Essential Infrastructure (Common App partner). **5 White Space Opportunities:** (1) International Innovation Leader (Maia + SCOIR-level AI = unassailable), (2) Value International Platform (global reach + $3-5 pricing = 10K+ unserved schools), (3) Statewide Global Partnerships (Xello's free model applied internationally), (4) Native Mobile-First Platform (NO competitor has native apps), (5) AI-First Career Exploration (beat Xello with AI). **Movement Analysis (Trajectory Predictions):** SCOIR moving toward comprehensive (threat increasing), SchooLinks expanding Texas → national, Naviance declining (40% → 30-35%), Xello stable in career niche, Cialfo uncertain (3 scenarios: improve/merge/decline), Maia recommended trajectory: International Innovation Leader (develop AI Q1-Q2 2026) + Value Expansion (tiered pricing Q3-Q4 2026). **Key Findings:** (1) Maia occupies UNIQUE "Global Premium Comprehensive" position (no direct competitor), (2) SCOIR greatest threat (moving toward Maia's position with superior AI), (3) Pricing gap ($10 vs. $3.50-6) creates US vulnerability, (4) Cialfo poor 2.4/5 reviews = major Asia-Pacific opportunity, (5) White space opportunities are large (first-mover advantages), (6) International moat defensible (6 of 7 competitors US-only). Strategic priorities confirmed and refined from positioning analysis. Saved as competitive-positioning-map.md in 04-STRATEGIC-INSIGHTS folder.
