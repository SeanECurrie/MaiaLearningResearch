## Outlook and Implications

2. **Mobile Improvements:** Still not native app, but better responsive design
3. **Personalization:** Dynamic content based on student profiles
4. **Navigation Streamlining:** Reducing clicks, improving workflows

**Goal:** Retain existing customer base and slow churn to SCOIR, SchooLinks, Xello

**Competitive Position:** Playing catch-up vs. leading innovation

### Threats and Opportunities

**🔴 MAJOR THREATS:**

1. **SCOIR's AI 2.0 + Common App Integration (2025-26)**
   - SCOIR launched AI acceptance predictions, college list balancing, essay review
   - Deep Common App 2025-26 integration creating switching incentive
   - 5-star mobile app (1,800+ reviews) vs. Naviance's desktop-only
   - **Risk:** Naviance private schools switching to SCOIR in droves

2. **SchooLinks' Price Disruption**
   - $3.50-5.51/student (50% cheaper than Naviance)
   - Winning large public school districts on price
   - Modern platform competitive on features
   - **Risk:** Budget-conscious districts switching to save 40-50%

3. **Xello's Career Engagement Dominance**
   - 28-year career focus (14x more engagement than college-first platforms)
   - K-12 career development continuum (grades 6-12)
   - Strong Canadian/US dual presence
   - **Risk:** Schools prioritizing career readiness choosing Xello

4. **Platform Obsolescence**
   - Aging technology stack vs. cloud-native competitors
   - No native mobile app (students expect mobile-first)
   - Slower innovation cycle
   - **Risk:** Becoming "legacy software" that schools tolerate but don't love

**🟢 OPPORTUNITIES:**

1. **PowerSchool Ecosystem Cross-Sell**
   - 45M students in PowerSchool SIS network
   - Only 10M in Naviance = 35M potential expansion
   - Bundled pricing advantage

2. **2025-2026 Refresh Could Improve Satisfaction**
   - If UI/UX improvements address complaints
   - Could reduce churn and improve NPS

3. **Intersect College Recruitment Revenue**
   - Unique two-sided marketplace (students + colleges)
   - 200+ colleges using platform
   - Additional revenue stream competitors lack

### Strategic Recommendations

**For Schools Evaluating Naviance:**

1. **If Currently Using Naviance:**
   - Wait for 2025-2026 refresh before switching (sunk cost in data migration)
   - Negotiate pricing aggressively (leverage competitive alternatives)
   - Demand roadmap commitments (AI, mobile app, integrations)

2. **If Considering Naviance:**
   - **Avoid** unless deeply integrated with PowerSchool SIS already
   - Better alternatives: SCOIR (innovation), SchooLinks (price), Xello (career), Maia (international/premium)
   - Only advantage: Market leadership and scattergram data scale

**For Competitors (Maia Learning):**

1. **Attack Naviance's Weaknesses:**
   - **Pricing:** Emphasize value vs. Naviance's premium ($7.11)
   - **Satisfaction:** Highlight poor 3.2/5 ratings vs. Maia's quality
   - **Innovation:** Contrast Maia's modern platform vs. Naviance legacy

2. **Target Naviance's Vulnerable Segments:**
   - **US Private Schools:** Dissatisfied with Naviance (3.2/5), willing to pay premium for quality
   - **International Schools:** Naviance has ZERO presence (Maia's 70+ countries)
   - **Districts Re-Evaluating:** Schools at contract renewal (every 3-5 years)

3. **Differentiate on Strengths:**
   - International reach (Maia's 70+ countries vs. Naviance US-only)
   - Modern platform (avoid "legacy" label)
   - Premium positioning (quality over market share)
