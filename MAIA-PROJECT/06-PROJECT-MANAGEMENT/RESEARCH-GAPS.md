# Research Gaps & Future Deep Dives

**Purpose:** Track areas where information is limited or needs deeper investigation.

---

## Current Gaps

### Data Availability Gaps

**Pricing Information:**
- Most competitors don't publish pricing publicly
- Will need to rely on indirect evidence, reviews, RFPs
- May find some pricing through review sites (G2, Capterra)

**Technical Architecture:**
- Limited public information on backend systems
- Focus on user-facing features instead
- Note integrations and APIs where available

**Financial Performance:**
- Most are private companies
- Limited revenue/funding information
- Will focus on market indicators instead

## Areas Flagged for Deep Dive

*To be populated as research progresses and priority areas emerge*

### High Priority
*Empty - will be filled as research uncovers important areas*

### Medium Priority
*Empty - will be filled during analysis phase*

### Low Priority / Nice to Have
*Empty - will be filled as interesting tangents emerge*

## Methodology for Handling Gaps

1. **Document clearly** - Note what's not available
2. **Use indirect evidence** - Customer reviews, news articles, analyst reports
3. **Make informed inferences** - Based on available data, note as inference
4. **Flag for deep dive** - If gap is critical to analysis
5. **Accept limitations** - Some information simply won't be available
