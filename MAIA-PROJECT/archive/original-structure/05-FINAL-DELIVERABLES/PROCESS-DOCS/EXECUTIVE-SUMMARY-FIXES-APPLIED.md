### 2. Naviance Pricing Corrected ($6-8 → $8-12 est.)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Impact:** Resolves critical pricing inconsistency, aligns with authoritative source

**Changes Made:**

| Location | Original | Corrected |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Key Finding #4 | "Naviance: $6-8 (20-40% less)" | "Naviance: $8-12 (est.) (overlapping range, 20% less to 20% more)" |
| Pricing comparison | "$6-8" | "$8-12 (est.)" |
| All Naviance mentions | No "(est.)" disclaimer | "(est.)" added consistently |

**Methodology Note Added:**

> **Note on Pricing Data:** Naviance pricing is not publicly disclosed; the $8-12 range is estimated based on industry sources, competitive intelligence, and school district budget documents. Actual pricing may vary by district size, contract terms, and negotiation.

**Rationale:**
- pricing-analysis-top4-viz.html (authoritative pricing document) cites $8-12 (est.)
- Naviance does not publish pricing publicly (quote-based, opaque model)
- Industry sources and district budgets support $8-12 range
- Original $6-8 may have been outdated (2023-2024 pricing)

**Instances Updated:** 3 main references + pricing methodology note

---

### 3. SCOIR Pricing Corrected ($5-6 → $4.80)

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Impact:** Aligns with specific verified pricing, improves accuracy

**Changes Made:**

| Location | Original | Corrected |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| Key Finding #2 | "SCOIR $5-6/student (50% less than Maia's $10)" | "SCOIR $4.80/student (52% less than Maia's $10)" |
| Competitive Dynamics | "Pricing: SCOIR $5-6/student" | "Pricing: SCOIR $4.80/student" |
| Priority 2 Recommendation | "Competes with: SCOIR ($5-6)" | "Competes with: SCOIR ($4.80)" |
| Tiered pricing tiers | "SCOIR ($5-6)" | "SCOIR ($4.80)" |

**Rationale:**
- pricing-analysis-top4-viz.html table shows specific $4.80 (line 75)
- $4.80 appears to be current published rate (2025)
- $5-6 was likely rounded or older data
- Specific price more accurate than range for transparent pricing platform

**Instances Updated:** 4 main references throughout document

---

## Priority 2 High Priority Fixes (COMPLETED ✅)

### 4. Enhanced Maia Inferred Rating Disclaimer

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Impact:** Matches HTML transparency level, prevents misunderstanding

**Original Disclaimer:**
> Maia's inferred 4.0-4.5/5 rating
> (Brief mentions of "inferred" throughout, some context about retention)

**Enhanced Disclaimer (Added after Key Finding #1):**

> **Important Note on Maia's Satisfaction Rating:** The 4.0-4.5/5 rating cited throughout this report is an **INFERRED** estimate, not a verified customer rating from review platforms (unlike SCOIR's verified 4.5-4.7/5 from G2, 2024 or Naviance's 3.2/5 from Capterra, 2024).
>
> **Inference Basis:**
> - Customer retention indicators: Long-term relationships (5-7+ years average, estimated from 2.5M student base stability)
> - Anecdotal evidence: "Legendary customer service" references in research, "world-class support" positioning
> - Lack of negative reviews: No public complaints on review sites (vs. Naviance 3.2/5 from Capterra, Cialfo 2.4/5 from MouthShut)
> - Referral indicators: 70+ country expansion suggests word-of-mouth success
> - Competitive benchmark: Positioned between SCOIR's verified 4.5-4.7/5 (G2, 2024) and industry average 3.5-4.0/5
>
> **Confidence Level:** MEDIUM. This is an estimate based on indirect signals.
>
> **Recommendation:** Conduct formal customer satisfaction survey and publish verified ratings to validate this assessment (see Strategic Recommendation #5).

**Impact:**
- Transparency increased dramatically
- Distinguishes inferred vs. verified ratings clearly
- Includes recommendation to validate via formal survey
- Matches HTML disclaimer standard from competitive-positioning-viz.html
