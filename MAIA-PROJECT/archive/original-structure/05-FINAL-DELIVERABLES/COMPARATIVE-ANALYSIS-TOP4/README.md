## Why Top 4 Focus?

### Competitive Rationale

**These 4 competitors represent Maia's primary US competitive threats:**

1. **Naviance** (40% market share) - Legacy leader with dominant market position but poor customer satisfaction (3.2/5)
2. **SCOIR** (12% market share, 40-50% growth) - Innovation leader with AI 2.0, highest satisfaction (4.7/5), greatest threat
3. **SchooLinks** ($88.3M funding) - Value leader ($3.50-5.51/student), state compliance specialist (Texas CCMR)
4. **Xello** (28-year veteran) - Career-first specialist ($3.60/student), statewide contract model

**Why Excluded Competitors Were Filtered Out:**

- **Cialfo:** Asia-Pacific geographic focus (minimal US presence), poor reviews (2.4/5) = different market
- **MajorClarity:** CTE niche focus, US-only, limited brand recognition = different product category
- **Common App:** NOT a competitor - essential infrastructure partner for all platforms

### Executive Clarity

**Top-4 filtering provides:**
- ✅ Clearer strategic focus on direct US market competitors
- ✅ Simplified tables and charts for executive presentations
- ✅ More actionable insights (fewer variables to analyze)
- ✅ Better alignment with US market strategy discussions

## Key Findings Summary

### Maia's Competitive Position (vs Top 4)

**Unique Strengths:**
- 🌍 **International Moat:** 70+ countries (all 4 competitors are US-only)
- 🌐 **Deep Multilingual:** 12+ languages with cultural localization (vs competitors' AI translation)
- ⭐ **High Satisfaction:** Strong customer service (vs Naviance's poor 3.2/5 reviews)

**Critical Challenges:**
- 💰 **Pricing Gap:** $10/student (2-3x more expensive than competitors' $3.50-6 range)
- 🤖 **AI Gap:** Letter writing only vs SCOIR AI 2.0 (predictions, balancing) & SchooLinks Agentic Layer
- 📱 **No Native Mobile App:** None of top 5 have native apps = first-mover opportunity

### Threat Assessment

| Competitor | Threat Level | Key Strengths | Maia's Defense |
|------------|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| **SCOIR** | 🔴 Very High | AI innovation, Common App integration, high growth (40-50%/year) | International markets, service quality |
| **SchooLinks** | 🟡 Medium-High | Lowest pricing ($3.50-5.51), state compliance (Texas CCMR) | International, private schools |
| **Xello** | 🟡 Medium-High | Career-first expertise (28 years), statewide contracts (FL, NH) | International, college-prep focus |
| **Naviance** | 🟡 Medium | 40% market share, legacy relationships, decades of data | Poor reviews (3.2/5) = opportunity |
