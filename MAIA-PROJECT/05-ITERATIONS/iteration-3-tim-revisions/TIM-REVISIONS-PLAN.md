## Phase 2: Strategic Recommendations Revision

### Task 2.1: Revise Executive Summary Strategic Recommendations
**Objective:** Flip strategy to US-primary with international-bonus framing

**Current Structure (to be changed):**
- Recommendation priority order emphasizes international positioning
- US market treated as secondary/switcher opportunity

**New Structure (Tim's direction):**
```
PRIMARY RECOMMENDATION: Attack US Market
├─ Sub-component 1: Adjust pricing (tiered model, target public schools)
├─ Sub-component 2: Accelerate AI introduction (match SCOIR AI 2.0)
├─ Sub-component 3: Deepen Common App integration
└─ Investment framing: "If you invest in [X], you can get [Y]"

BONUS/SIMULTANEOUS BENEFIT: International Market Gains
├─ AI investment benefits international customers automatically
├─ Common App integration supports international applicants
└─ Positioning: Dual market strategy with single investment
```

**Specific Text Changes Needed:**
- [ ] Reorder recommendations (US market becomes #1)
- [ ] Reframe "double down on international" as secondary benefit
- [ ] Add "biggest market in the world" language for US
- [ ] Emphasize "accelerate AI as quickly as possible"
- [ ] Add "lower price and go after public schools" strategy
- [ ] Create "investment → dual benefits" framing throughout

**Files to Edit:**
- `executive-summary-CORRECTED.docx` - Strategic Recommendations section
- `strategic-recommendations-viz-ENTERPRISE.pdf` - May need content revision
- Check if Full Report needs same changes

**Skill Reference:** Use **document-skills:docx** for DOCX editing

---

### Task 2.2: Revise Full Report Strategic Recommendations

```

**Files to Edit:**

## Key Quotes from Tim to Remember

### On Strategic Direction:
> "The real answer is you've got to adjust your fucking prices and go after the biggest market in the world, which is the U.S. market."

> "If you decide to invest in AI, deeper integration with Common App, and you fix your pricing, then you can attack the U.S. market while simultaneously what you just did benefits the international market as well."

> "I kind of want to offer a, if you invest, this is what you can get."

> "Accelerate AI introduction as quickly as possible" then "lower the price and go after public schools."

### On Positioning Maps:
> "NOT an XY axis scatter plot"

> "Should be a four-quadrant map - one horizontal line intersecting one vertical line in the middle (like a cross or plus sign)"

> "The AI-generated graphic 'snuck past' him because it was missing the actual crossbar lines"

### On Tone:
> "Clean and professional presentation throughout. No need to get cute with the formatting or content."
