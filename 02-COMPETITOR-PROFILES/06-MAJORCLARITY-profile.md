## Executive Summary

**Company:** MajorClarity
**Founded:** 2014
**Headquarters:** Richmond, Virginia, USA
**Founders:** Atticus Francken and Cale Sennett
**Current Ownership:** Edmentum (acquired October 29, 2025)
**Previous Owner:** Paper (acquired March 2023)
**Funding:** Not publicly disclosed (bootstrapped/unfunded prior to acquisitions)
**Market Focus:** US K-12 Career & College Readiness (CCR)
**Primary Audience:** Grades 6-12 (middle school and high school)
**Website:** https://majorclarity.com/

**Threat Level to Maia Learning:** LOW-MEDIUM

### Quick Overview

MajorClarity is a career and college readiness platform that translates students' career discovery into actionable academic plans and postsecondary opportunities. Founded in 2014, the company underwent two significant acquisitions—first by Paper in March 2023, then by Edmentum on October 29, 2025 (very recent). The platform is distinguished by its career "test-drives"—interactive career exploration activities that have been shown to increase student engagement by 189% in building career-aligned academic plans.

**Key Differentiators:**
- **189% Impact:** Students who complete career test-drives are 189% more likely to create career-aligned plans
- **CTE Integration:** Now part of Edmentum Career, uniting career discovery with 180+ CTE courses across 57 pathways
- **K-12 Scope:** Grades 6-12 coverage, starting career exploration in middle school
- **Micro-Credentials:** Competency-based credentialing system
- **Work-Based Learning:** Integrated WBL tracking tools

**Strategic Position:**
MajorClarity's recent acquisition by Edmentum fundamentally changes its competitive positioning. As a standalone platform, it was a modest competitor focused primarily on career exploration and academic planning. However, combined with Edmentum Career's extensive CTE curricula (180+ semesters, 57 pathways), it now represents the "only end-to-end solution connecting career discovery, academic planning, high-impact curricula, and certification preparation" according to Edmentum. This positions MajorClarity as a CTE-focused alternative rather than a direct college counseling competitor to Maia Learning.

**Key Strengths:**
- Strong CTE and career readiness focus
- Backed by Edmentum's resources and distribution
- Evidence-based impact (189% improvement in career-aligned planning)
- 70+ ready-to-use lesson plans for educators
- Seamless 4-year and 6-year academic planning tools

**Key Weaknesses:**
- Limited brand recognition in college counseling market
- Two acquisitions in three years suggests potential integration challenges
- Not mentioned among top competitors (SCOIR, Maia) in industry analysis
- Minimal customer review data available
- Recent ownership change may create uncertainty

**Revenue Model:** Subscription-based, per-student pricing ($5/student for NTHS members, pricing varies by district size)

   - 2025: Edmentum acquisition (October 29—very recent!)
   - **Risks:** Integration challenges, product roadmap uncertainty, customer confusion

   - Potential product changes, feature consolidation
   - Uncertainty for existing customers during transition

6. **Limited AI Capabilities:**

   - Unlike Cialfo's Direct Apply to 75,000+ programs
   - Unlike SCOIR's college partnerships and demonstrated interest tracking
   - No proprietary university relationships mentioned

8. **Not College-Counseling Leader:**
   - Positioned as CTE/career-first rather than college-first
   - May be less competitive for college-prep focused schools
   - Private schools may prefer SCOIR or Maia's college counseling tools
   - Fewer college-specific features than dedicated college counseling platforms

9. **Pricing Transparency:**
   - District pricing not publicly disclosed (varies by size)
   - Harder for schools to budget and compare
   - Add-on costs for Work-Based Learning extension ($1,000 minimum)
   - Lack of transparent pricing may slow sales cycle

10. **Limited EdTech Industry Recognition:**
    - No major EdTech awards (unlike Xello's TIME 2025 Top EdTech)
    - Not featured in major EdTech innovation lists
    - Fewer media mentions than top competitors

### Opportunities

   - Growing state mandates for career readiness
   - 3E accountability frameworks (Enrollment, Employment, Enlistment) spreading
   - Perfect timing for CTE-focused platform

2. **Gen Z Postsecondary Awareness Gap:**
   - Gallup/Walton/JFF research: Gen Z students lack awareness of postsecondary options
   - Less than 30% feel prepared for pathways beyond 4-year college
   - Growing demand for career exploration tools
   - MajorClarity's career test-drives address this gap directly

3. **Career-Connected Learning (CCL) Movement:**
   - Research shows engagement increases with CCL participation
   - Absenteeism decreases when students are more engaged
   - Strong CTE programs improve graduation rates
   - MajorClarity positioned to capitalize on CCL trend

4. **Naviance Switcher Market:**
   - Testimonial evidence of districts switching FROM Naviance TO MajorClarity
   - Naviance customer service complaints create switching opportunity
   - Better engagement (50% vs. 15%) is compelling differentiator
   - Reddit evidence of schools making the switch

5. **Edmentum Cross-Sell Opportunities:**
   - Edmentum has existing customer base across all 50 states
   - Cross-selling MajorClarity to Edmentum Courseware/Exact Path/Study Island customers
   - Bundling MajorClarity + Edmentum Career for comprehensive CCR solution
   - Distribution leverage through Edmentum's sales force

6. **Concentration Research Adoption:**
   - Research: Students need 3+ courses in CTE pathway for best outcomes
   - MajorClarity + Edmentum Career enables multi-year pathway concentration
   - Districts seeking to implement "concentration" strategies are ideal customers
   - Competitive advantage over platforms without curricula

7. **Work-Based Learning Demand:**
   - Growing state requirements for WBL experiences
   - Internship and apprenticeship tracking becoming essential
   - MajorClarity's WBL module addresses compliance needs
   - Employer partnership facilitation is valuable

8. **Micro-Credentials Trend:**
   - Industry moving toward competency-based credentialing
   - Students need to demonstrate employability skills
   - Digital badges gaining acceptance in hiring
   - MajorClarity's micro-credential system is ahead of curve

9. **Counselor Caseload Crisis:**
   - Caseloads 50% above recommended levels nationally
   - Districts desperate for scalable personalized planning solutions
   - Automation and streamlined tools are critical
   - MajorClarity's scalability is key value proposition

10. **Cialfo's Poor Reviews Create Opportunity:**
    - Cialfo (Asia-Pacific competitor) has 2.4/5, 2.5/5, 1.0/5 ratings
    - If MajorClarity expands internationally, can capitalize on Cialfo dissatisfaction
    - Quality differentiation opportunity

### Threats

1. **Competitive Market with Well-Funded Players:**
   - SchooLinks: $88.3M funding, aggressive growth
   - Cialfo: $91.2M funding (though poor reviews)
   - SCOIR: $28.25M funding, 12% market share, high momentum
   - Naviance: Market leader, massive installed base
   - MajorClarity has no disclosed funding, relying on Edmentum backing

2. **Maia Learning and SCOIR Gaining Traction:**
   - Inside Higher Ed (2023): "MaiaLearning and Scoir are gaining ground against Naviance"
   - MajorClarity NOT mentioned in this analysis
   - Risk of being left out of "top tier" conversation
   - Perception as second-tier competitor

3. **Integration Challenges Post-Acquisition:**
   - Edmentum acquisition only two weeks old (as of this profile)
   - Technical integration of MajorClarity + Edmentum Career
   - Organizational culture integration
   - Potential product roadmap conflicts
   - Customer retention during transition

4. **AI Race in EdTech:**
   - SCOIR launched "Scoir AI" in 2025
   - Competitors adding AI counselor assistants, chatbots, predictive analytics
   - MajorClarity has no prominent AI features
   - Risk of appearing outdated without AI capabilities

5. **Private School Market Loss:**
   - MajorClarity's CTE focus less relevant for private college-prep schools
   - SCOIR and Maia dominating private school market
   - Limited ability to compete in this segment

6. **International Market Exclusion:**
   - Maia Learning: 70+ countries
   - Cialfo: Asia-Pacific dominance
   - MajorClarity: US-only
   - Missing large international school market

7. **Economic Pressures on School Budgets:**
   - Budget cuts may favor cheaper alternatives (Xello $3.60/student, SchooLinks $3.50-5.51)
   - Districts consolidating platforms to save costs
   - May prefer free or low-cost solutions

8. **Naviance Lock-In:**
   - Naviance has massive installed base and data lock-in
   - Historical scattergram data valuable to schools
   - Switching costs are high (data migration, training, resistance)
   - Difficult to dislodge incumbent despite service issues

9. **State-Specific Compliance Complexity:**
   - SchooLinks excels at state compliance (Texas CCMR, PGP, TEA)
   - Every state has different CCR requirements
   - Keeping up with 50 states' changing mandates is resource-intensive
   - SchooLinks' compliance focus is competitive advantage

10. **Review Transparency Expectations:**
    - EdTech buyers increasingly expect third-party reviews and ratings
    - MajorClarity's lack of review presence may hurt credibility
    - Competitors with transparent (even if mixed) reviews build more trust

11. **Common App Direct Integration Risk:**
    - If Common App builds career/planning features directly
    - If Common App partners exclusively with a competitor
    - MajorClarity's college application value proposition weakens

12. **Xello's Statewide Contracts:**
    - Xello has Florida (all K-12 free), New Hampshire (all HS free) statewide deals
    - Hard to compete when competitor is provided free to all students
    - Risk of more states adopting statewide contracts with competitors

## Strategic Recommendations for Maia Learning

### Threat Assessment

**Overall Threat Level: LOW-MEDIUM**

**Rationale:**
1. **Limited Direct Competition:** MajorClarity is positioned as CTE/career-first platform, while Maia Learning is comprehensive college + career counseling with strong international presence
2. **Different Markets:** MajorClarity targets US CTE-focused districts; Maia serves international schools, multilingual environments, college-prep programs
3. **No Brand Momentum:** MajorClarity not mentioned in industry analyses naming SCOIR and Maia as Naviance's top competitors
4. **Recent Acquisition Uncertainty:** Two acquisitions in three years creates integration risk and customer uncertainty

**Where MajorClarity Poses Threat to Maia:**
- **US Public School CTE Programs:** MajorClarity's Edmentum backing and CTE integration are strong in this segment
- **Career-First Districts:** Schools prioritizing workforce readiness over college counseling
- **Budget-Conscious US Districts:** Comparable pricing with CTE curricula bundling may be attractive
- **State 3E Compliance:** Districts focused on Enrollment/Employment/Enlistment accountability

**Where Maia Learning is Safe from MajorClarity:**
- **International Schools:** MajorClarity has zero international presence (vs. Maia's 70+ countries)
- **Multilingual Markets:** MajorClarity appears English-only (vs. Maia's localization)
- **Private College-Prep Schools:** MajorClarity's CTE focus is less relevant
- **College-Centric Counseling:** Schools prioritizing 4-year college pathways
- **Global-Minded Students:** Families seeking international postsecondary options

### Competitive Strategies

**1. Emphasize International Advantage:**
- **Action:** Highlight Maia's 70+ country presence vs. MajorClarity's US-only market
- **Messaging:** "Global college counseling platform vs. US-focused career readiness tool"
- **Target:** International schools, globally-minded families, multilingual districts
- **Differentiation:** Maia serves students pursuing universities worldwide, not just US options

**2. Position as Comprehensive College + Career (Not CTE-Only):**
- **Action:** Emphasize Maia's balanced approach to ALL postsecondary pathways
- **Messaging:** "Comprehensive college and career counseling, not just CTE tracking"
- **Target:** Schools that prioritize 4-year college preparation alongside career readiness
- **Differentiation:** Maia doesn't force schools to choose between college-prep and career-prep

**3. Leverage 22-Year Track Record:**
- **Action:** Contrast Maia's 22-year stability with MajorClarity's two acquisitions in three years
- **Messaging:** "Trusted partner since 2003, consistent product roadmap, no ownership uncertainty"
- **Target:** Risk-averse schools, long-term planning-focused administrators
- **Differentiation:** Stability and reliability vs. integration risk

**4. Highlight Private School Strength:**
- **Action:** Target private schools where CTE is less relevant
- **Messaging:** "Built for college-prep programs, trusted by leading independent schools"
- **Target:** Private schools, religious schools, college-prep academies
- **Differentiation:** Maia's college counseling features vs. MajorClarity's CTE focus

**5. Develop Maia's Career Readiness Features:**
- **Action:** Invest in career exploration and work-based learning capabilities
- **Rationale:** Don't cede career readiness territory entirely to MajorClarity
- **Focus:** Career assessments, interest inventories, career exploration content
- **Differentiation:** Balanced career AND college (not career-first)

**6. Emphasize Personalized Counseling:**
- **Action:** Highlight Maia's counselor-centric design and relationship-building tools
- **Messaging:** "Built by counselors for counselors, not just automated planning"
- **Target:** Schools that value human counselor relationships over automated systems
- **Differentiation:** Personalized guidance vs. scalable automation

**7. Build Transparent Review Presence:**
- **Action:** Generate customer reviews on Capterra, G2 Crowd, EdSurge
- **Rationale:** MajorClarity has minimal review presence—Maia can win on transparency
- **Focus:** Encourage satisfied customers to share experiences
- **Differentiation:** Transparent third-party validation vs. limited reviews

**8. Monitor Edmentum Integration Progress:**
- **Action:** Track MajorClarity's post-acquisition integration challenges
- **Opportunity:** If integration is rocky, reach out to MajorClarity customers about switching
- **Timing:** 6-12 months post-acquisition (integration pain points emerge)
- **Differentiation:** Stability vs. transition uncertainty

### Opportunities to Capitalize

**1. International Expansion:**
- **Opportunity:** MajorClarity will likely remain US-focused; Maia can dominate international markets
- **Action:** Double down on international school partnerships, multilingual content, global university database
- **Markets:** Europe, Asia, Middle East, Latin America, Africa

**2. College-Prep School Focus:**
- **Opportunity:** MajorClarity's CTE focus leaves college-prep schools underserved
- **Action:** Target private schools, independent schools, IB programs

**3. Career Feature Parity:**
- **Opportunity:** Add career exploration features to compete in career readiness space
- **Action:** Develop career assessments, interest inventories, work-based learning tracking
- **Goal:** Comprehensive college + career without being CTE-only

**4. Switcher Marketing:**
- **Opportunity:** MajorClarity's acquisition creates uncertainty for existing customers
- **Action:** "Stability and Continuity" campaign targeting MajorClarity users
- **Messaging:** "No acquisition uncertainty, consistent roadmap, trusted for 22 years"

**5. Advanced AI Features:**
- **Opportunity:** MajorClarity lacks prominent AI capabilities
- **Action:** Develop AI-powered counselor assistants, predictive analytics, chatbots
- **Differentiation:** Modern AI tools vs. algorithm-based personalization

**6. Cialfo Switcher Opportunity in Asia-Pacific:**
- **Opportunity:** Cialfo (MajorClarity's Asia-Pacific counterpart) has terrible reviews (2.4/5, 2.5/5, 1.0/5)
- **Action:** Target Asia-Pacific international schools dissatisfied with Cialfo
- **Messaging:** Quality and satisfaction vs. poor reviews

### Defensive Measures

- **Challenge:** MajorClarity has strong CTE positioning in US public schools
- **Defense:** Build partnerships with US state education agencies, develop state compliance resources
- **Goal:** Don't cede US public school market entirely

- **Challenge:** MajorClarity excels at CTE pathway tracking and 3E accountability
- **Defense:** Add CTE pathway planning, work-based learning tracking, state compliance reporting

- **Challenge:** MajorClarity emphasizes customer success and 50% usage rates
- **Defense:** Invest in customer success team, usage analytics, proactive support
- **Goal:** Match or exceed 50% student usage rates

**5. Educator Resources:**
- **Challenge:** MajorClarity offers 70+ ready-to-use lesson plans
- **Defense:** Develop lesson plan library, professional development resources, CCR curricula mapping
- **Goal:** Competitive parity in educator support

### Key Differentiators for Maia to Emphasize

## Key Findings

### Company Summary

**MajorClarity** is a **US-focused career and college readiness platform** founded in 2014 by Atticus Francken and Cale Sennett. After operating independently for nine years, the company was acquired by Paper (a Montreal-based tutoring company) in March 2023, then acquired by Edmentum (a digital learning solutions provider) on October 29, 2025—**less than two weeks before this profile was written**. The recent Edmentum acquisition fundamentally repositions MajorClarity from a standalone career exploration platform to part of a comprehensive end-to-end solution combining **career discovery, academic planning, CTE curricula (180+ courses across 57 pathways), and industry certification preparation**.

### Market Position

MajorClarity serves **US K-12 schools (grades 6-12)** with a focus on **career and technical education (CTE)** programs and **career-connected learning (CCL)**. Unlike competitors Maia Learning (70+ countries), Cialfo (Asia-Pacific), and even Xello (North America), MajorClarity has **no international presence**. The platform is positioned as a **CTE-first, career readiness platform** rather than a college counseling platform, differentiating it from SCOIR and Maia Learning.

**Market recognition is limited:** MajorClarity was **not mentioned** in major industry analyses (Inside Higher Ed's "Companies offer new competition to Naviance," College Placement Consulting's competitive landscape) that highlighted **SCOIR and Maia Learning** as Naviance's top challengers. This suggests MajorClarity occupies a **smaller, more niche market position** focused on CTE-oriented districts.

### Key Strengths

1. **Evidence-Based Impact:** 189% increase in students building career-aligned plans; 50% student usage rates (vs. 15% industry average)
2. **Unique Career Test-Drives:** Interactive career simulations with professional interviews—no competitor offers this exact methodology
3. **Edmentum Integration:** Now part of only end-to-end solution combining discovery, planning, curricula, and certification
4. **CTE Timing Advantage:** 40 states approved 152+ CTE policies in 2024; perfect market conditions
5. **Comprehensive Scope:** Grades 6-12, 4-year and 6-year planning, work-based learning, micro-credentials
6. **Educator Resources:** 70+ ready-to-use lesson plans, reducing teacher prep burden
7. **Scalability:** Addresses counselor caseload crisis (50% above recommended levels) through automation

### Critical Weaknesses

1. **Two Acquisitions in Three Years:** 2023 (Paper) and 2025 (Edmentum)—creates integration risk and customer uncertainty
2. **Limited Brand Recognition:** Not mentioned in industry competitive analyses alongside SCOIR and Maia
3. **Minimal Customer Reviews:** No presence on major EdTech review platforms; difficult to validate quality
4. **No International Presence:** US-only market, English-only, missing international school segment entirely
5. **Recent Acquisition Risk:** Edmentum deal is **less than two weeks old**—integration still underway, uncertainty for customers
6. **Limited AI Capabilities:** Algorithm-based personalization, not AI-powered (vs. SCOIR AI, Naviance AI tools)
7. **CTE-First Positioning:** Less competitive for college-prep focused schools and private schools

### Competitive Landscape

**MajorClarity vs. Maia Learning:**

| Dimension | MajorClarity | Maia Learning |
|-----------|--------------|---------------|
| **Founded** | 2014 (11 years) | 2003 (22 years) |
| **Ownership** | Edmentum (Oct 2025) | Independent |
| **Geography** | US-only | 70+ countries |
| **Languages** | English-only | Multilingual |
| **Focus** | CTE/career-first | Comprehensive college + career |
| **Market** | Public schools (CTE) | International, private schools |
| **Pricing** | ~$5/student | ~$7-10/student |
| **Integration** | Edmentum CTE curricula | Independent platform |
| **Recognition** | Limited | Named top Naviance competitor |
| **Reviews** | Minimal data | Limited data |

**Threat Assessment:** **LOW-MEDIUM**
- **Direct competition:** Minimal (different market segments)
- **US Public School CTE:** MajorClarity stronger
- **International:** Maia stronger
- **College-Prep:** Maia stronger
- **Career Readiness:** MajorClarity stronger (CTE integration)

### Pricing and Value

**Pricing:** ~$5/student (NTHS pricing point), district pricing varies by size, Work-Based Learning extension $1,000 minimum.

**Value Proposition:**
- Comprehensive career and academic planning
- 189% proven impact on career-aligned planning
- 70+ educator lesson plans included
- CTE pathway tracking and compliance
- Work-based learning module (add-on)
- Micro-credentials system
- Post-Edmentum acquisition: Bundling with 180+ CTE courses

**ROI:** High student engagement (50% usage rates) and measurable outcomes (189% improvement) justify cost.

### Strategic Implications for Maia Learning

**Low-Medium Threat Assessment Rationale:**

**Why Threat is LOW:**
1. **Different Markets:** MajorClarity = US CTE public schools; Maia = international schools, college-prep
2. **No International Overlap:** MajorClarity has zero presence in Maia's 70+ countries
3. **Limited Recognition:** Not named among top competitors in industry analyses
4. **Acquisition Uncertainty:** Two ownership changes in three years creates instability
5. **CTE Focus:** Less relevant for college-counseling focused schools

**Why Threat is MEDIUM (Not Negligible):**
1. **Edmentum Backing:** Financial resources and nationwide distribution network
2. **CTE Policy Wave:** 152+ state policies in 2024 favor CTE-focused platforms
3. **Proven Engagement:** 50% usage rates and 189% impact are compelling
4. **US Public School Presence:** Growing share in large US K-12 market
5. **Career Readiness Trend:** All schools (including Maia's) adding career components

**Recommended Maia Strategy:**
1. **Emphasize International Advantage:** 70+ countries vs. US-only
2. **Leverage Stability:** 22 years, no acquisitions vs. two in three years
3. **Position as Comprehensive:** College + career balance vs. CTE-first
4. **Target Private Schools:** Where CTE is less relevant
5. **Build Career Features:** Don't cede career readiness entirely
6. **Monitor Integration:** Watch for MajorClarity + Edmentum challenges
7. **Transparent Reviews:** Build third-party review presence (MajorClarity lacks this)

**Opportunities:**
- International expansion (MajorClarity won't follow)
- Private/independent schools (MajorClarity's CTE focus less relevant)
- Advanced AI features (MajorClarity lacks this)
- Stability messaging during MajorClarity's integration period
- Asia-Pacific (Cialfo's poor reviews create opening)

**Safe Zones for Maia:**
- International schools
- Multilingual markets
- Private college-prep schools
- Global university counseling
- IB programs and international curricula

**Competitive Zones (Overlap):**
- US public schools with college + career programs
- Districts balancing college-prep and CTE
- Budget-conscious US districts
- Career readiness features and assessments
