## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

**Company:** SchooLinks, Inc.
**Positioning:** K-12 comprehensive college and career readiness platform with district-level focus and state-specific compliance
**Market Share:** Rapidly growing (14+ states, expanding to 50)
**Growth Rate:** 40%+ annually (Inc. 5000 for 3 consecutive years)
**Key Differentiator:** State-specific compliance automation + comprehensive K-12 coverage + Work-Based Learning focus + Agentic Layer AI (2025)

SchooLinks is a fast-growing competitor in the CCR space, founded in 2015 by Katie Fang to address the lack of accessible college and career planning resources for all students. The company secured the largest US edtech deal of 2024 with an $80M Series B round, bringing total funding to $88.3M. SchooLinks differentiates itself through district-level positioning, state-specific compliance features (particularly strong in Texas with CCMR tracking, PGP automation, and TEA accountability), comprehensive K-12 coverage including elementary-level CCR, and a robust Work-Based Learning platform with industry partner management. The company's recent "Agentic Layer" AI announcement (September 2025) positions them as an innovation leader moving beyond chatbot-based AI.

**Critical Competitive Threat to Maia:** SchooLinks' strong district-level sales motion, state-specific compliance automation, comprehensive K-12 coverage, and aggressive pricing ($3.50-$5.51/student) make them a formidable competitor, especially in Texas and other states with strict CCR requirements.

**Head-to-Head Competition:**

Reddit discussion (r/schoolcounseling) mentions:
> "Our college counseling office uses Maia and they like it better than Naviance. They are on either year three or four with Maia and are happy."

**Direct competition in RFPs** - SchooLinks and Maia likely compete for similar districts, with SchooLinks competing on price and domestic focus, Maia competing on international capabilities and counselor experience.

**SchooLinks poses a MODERATE threat to Maia:**
- Pricing advantage (roughly half the cost)
- Strong US state compliance (Maia's US focus is secondary to international)
- District-level features (CTE, WBL, compliance) that Maia lacks depth in
- However, Maia's international dominance is safe from SchooLinks

### 5.3 Go-to-Market Strategy

**Sales Motion:**

1. **District-Level Sales** - Target district leadership, not individual schools
2. **Large District Focus** - Prioritize 50k+ student districts for maximum impact
3. **RFP Response** - Compete in formal procurement processes
4. **State-by-State Expansion** - Build state-specific pages and features for all 50 states

**Geographic Strategy:**

- **Texas Domination** - Establish strong presence in Texas (Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Pflugerville, Midland)
- **Illinois Growth** - Chicago PS ($2M contract) as anchor, expand to suburbs (Naperville, Bunker Hill)
- **Washington Expansion** - Spokane as anchor
- **Nationwide Rollout** - State pages for all 50 states (Alabama through Wyoming)

- **State Compliance as Hook** - Lead with state-specific features (Texas CCMR, Arizona ECAP, Ohio requirements)
- **Naviance Replacement** - Position as modern alternative to legacy Naviance
- **TCO Reduction** - Emphasize consolidation of multiple tools
- **WBL Differentiation** - Lead with comprehensive WBL for CTE-focused districts

### 5.4 Competitive Threats & Weaknesses

**Threats to SchooLinks:**

1. **Naviance Market Dominance** - 40% market share, PowerSchool ecosystem, brand recognition
2. **SCOIR Network Effects** - 1.8k colleges, 1M+ users, growing faster (40-50% vs SchooLinks' 40%+)
3. **Pricing Competition** - SCOIR slightly cheaper ($4.80 vs $5.51), Naviance may compete on price
4. **Common App Integration** - SCOIR, Maia, and others have established integrations
5. **Limited International** - No international school presence (Maia dominates this)
6. **Brand Awareness** - Less known than Naviance, SCOIR (founded 2013)

**SchooLinks Weaknesses:**

1. **Third-Party Reviews Limited** - No G2/Capterra presence found (SCOIR has 4.5-4.8/5, Naviance 3.2-3.7/5)
2. **College Network Size** - Smaller college network than SCOIR (1.8k colleges)
3. **Historical Data** - Less scattergram data than Naviance (decades) or SCOIR (10+ years)
4. **Newer Platform** - 10 years old vs. Naviance's 25+ years (pro/con)

**Competitive Vulnerabilities:**

1. **Feature Parity** - Most competitors have similar core features (college search, apps, planning)
2. **AI Race** - SCOIR has Scoir AI, Maia has AI, SchooLinks launched Agentic Layer (competitive)
3. **Pricing Pressure** - SCOIR priced lower, may force SchooLinks to compete on price
4. **Customer Switching Costs** - Districts hesitant to switch from Naviance due to historical data

**Valuation:**

- **Post-Money Valuation:** Not disclosed
- **Last Funding Round:** Series B (September 2024)
- **Status:** Generating Revenue (per PitchBook)

**Investors' Thesis:**

Maia Sharpley (investor, Series A):
> "To investors like Maia Sharpley, a partner at Arthur Ventures, the company charges districts an annual license fee based on the number of students they serve." (EdSurge 2021)

The investment thesis appears to be:
- Large addressable market (50M+ K-12 students in US)
- Recurring revenue model (annual subscriptions)
- District-level sales = larger deal sizes
- Naviance replacement opportunity (40% market to capture)
- State compliance = sticky platform
- Strong customer retention

### 7.2 Revenue Model

**Primary Revenue Stream:**

**District Subscriptions** - Annual per-student licensing fees

**Revenue Drivers:**

1. **Student Count** - Revenue scales with district size
   - Chicago PS: 350k students × $5/student = $1.75M potential
   - Houston ISD: 200k students × $5/student = $1M potential
   - Dallas ISD: 150k students × $5/student = $750k potential

2. **Geographic Expansion** - 14 states (2021) → 50 states (2025)

3. **Feature Expansion** - Selling additional capabilities (WBL, elementary, etc.)

4. **Multi-Year Contracts** - Predictable recurring revenue

**Revenue Estimates (Speculative):**

Not publicly disclosed, but indicators:
- Large districts paying $900k-$2M annually
- If 100 large districts averaging $500k = $50M ARR
- If 500 medium districts averaging $100k = $50M ARR
- **Estimated ARR: $50-100M range** (pure speculation based on funding and growth)

**Unit Economics:**

- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):** High (RFP process, long sales cycles, district-level)
- **LTV (Lifetime Value):** High (multi-year contracts, 70%+ retention assumed)
- **Gross Margins:** High (SaaS typical 70-80%)
- **LTV/CAC Ratio:** Likely healthy given funding success

### 7.3 Growth Trajectory

**Growth Indicators:**

1. **Inc. 5000 Recognition** - 3 consecutive years (2022, 2023, 2024)
   - Indicates 40%+ annual revenue growth
   - #84 in Texas, #20 in Education

2. **Geographic Expansion**
   - 2021: 14 states (TX, IL, WA strongest)
   - 2025: All 50 states (state-specific pages built)

3. **Customer Growth**
   - Major urban districts: Chicago, Houston, Dallas, LA
   - Hundreds of districts nationwide

4. **Funding Growth**
   - 2021: $8.3M Series A
   - 2024: $80M Series B (10x increase)

**Growth Strategy:**

1. **Land and Expand**
   - Land: Win large anchor district in state
   - Expand: Win neighboring districts, add features

2. **State Dominance**
   - Texas: Dallas, Houston, San Antonio, Pflugerville, Midland → dominate Texas
   - Illinois: Chicago → expand to suburbs and state
   - Replicate in other states

3. **Naviance Displacement**
   - Target districts unhappy with Naviance
   - Emphasize modern platform, better support, lower cost

## 9. STRATEGIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MAIA LEARNING

### 9.1 SchooLinks as Competitive Threat to Maia

**Threat Level:** **MEDIUM-HIGH**

SchooLinks poses a **significant threat** to Maia Learning in specific areas:

**Direct Competition Areas:**

1. **US K-12 Market** - Both compete for US school districts
2. **Pricing** - SchooLinks roughly half the cost ($3.50-$5.51 vs ~$10/student)
3. **District-Level Sales** - Both target district-wide deployments
4. **Comprehensive Platforms** - Both offer all-in-one CCR solutions
5. **AI Innovation** - Both launched AI features (Maia 2024, SchooLinks Agentic Layer 2025)

**SchooLinks Advantages Over Maia:**

1. **Pricing** - Significant cost advantage (50% lower)
2. **State Compliance** - Deeper US state-specific features (Maia's international focus dilutes US compliance depth)
3. **Funding** - $88.3M vs. Maia's smaller funding (more resources for product development, sales)
4. **Work-Based Learning** - More comprehensive WBL platform
5. **K-12 Coverage** - Elementary included (Maia focuses on 6-12)
6. **US Market Focus** - 100% focused on US vs. Maia's 70+ countries

**Maia Advantages Over SchooLinks:**

1. **International Dominance** - 70+ countries, 12+ languages (SchooLinks US-only)
2. **Multilingual** - Serves diverse international schools (SchooLinks English-only)
3. **Counselor-Centric** - Exceptional counselor workflows and support
4. **Customer Service** - Legendary support reputation
5. **Common App Integration** - Established integration
6. **Brand Recognition** - Stronger in international school market

### 9.2 Defensive Strategies for Maia

**Priority 1: Protect International Market**

SchooLinks is US-only. Maia should:
- **Double down on international** - SchooLinks can't compete here
- **Multilingual expansion** - Add more languages (currently 12+)
- **International school partnerships** - Strengthen relationships
- **Regional customization** - IB, A-Levels, country-specific requirements

**Priority 2: Compete on Value, Not Just Price**

SchooLinks is cheaper ($3.50-$5.51 vs $10). Maia should:
- **Emphasize ROI** - Show counselor time savings, student outcomes
- **Counselor experience** - Highlight exceptional support (vs. SchooLinks' good but less proven support)
- **Implementation success** - Emphasize smooth rollouts, less risk
- **Total cost of ownership** - Consider training, switching costs, data migration

**Priority 3: Strengthen US State Compliance**

SchooLinks leads on state-specific features. Maia should:
- **Build Texas CCMR dashboard** - Match SchooLinks' Texas features
- **Add state-specific pages** - Like SchooLinks' 50-state approach
- **Automate compliance reporting** - Reduce manual work for counselors
- **State partnerships** - Partner with state education agencies

**Priority 4: Close Feature Gaps**

SchooLinks has 80+ features and emphasizes comprehensiveness. Maia should:
- **Elementary CCR** - Add K-5 features (SchooLinks has this, Maia doesn't)
- **Work-Based Learning** - Expand WBL platform to match SchooLinks
- **Industry Partner Portal** - Build dedicated portal for business partnerships
- **Alumni Outcomes Tracking** - Expand post-graduation tracking
- **CTE Program Dashboards** - Add real-time CTE tracking (SchooLinks strength)

**Priority 5: Communicate AI Innovation**

SchooLinks announced "Agentic Layer" (Sept 2025). Maia should:
- **Promote AI features** - Maia launched AI in 2024, but less visible
- **AI roadmap** - Publish clear AI roadmap and vision
- **Differentiate AI** - Explain how Maia's AI is unique/better
- **Customer AI stories** - Case studies showing AI impact

### 9.3 Offensive Strategies for Maia

**Opportunity 1: Target SchooLinks' Weaknesses**

- **Lack of reviews** - Emphasize Maia's visible customer satisfaction
- **International expansion** - If SchooLinks tries international, compete aggressively
- **Historical data** - Emphasize Maia's 15+ years of data vs. SchooLinks' 10 years
- **Implementation complexity** - Position Maia as easier to implement

**Opportunity 2: Win Head-to-Head RFPs**

When competing against SchooLinks in RFPs:
- **Emphasize counselor experience** - Counselors prefer Maia's workflow
- **Highlight support** - Maia's legendary support vs. SchooLinks' good support
- **Reference customers** - International and US customers praise Maia
- **Risk mitigation** - Proven platform vs. SchooLinks' rapid growth (potential growing pains)

**Opportunity 3: Partner Where Possible**

If not competing directly:
- **Data sharing** - Partner on college outcome data
- **Integration** - Integrate Maia and SchooLinks for districts using both (unlikely but possible)
- **Joint ventures** - Partner on international expansion (Maia) + US state compliance (SchooLinks)

**Opportunity 4: Acquire or Be Acquired**

- **Maia acquire SchooLinks** - Combine international + US state compliance (unlikely due to funding)
- **Joint acquisition target** - Both could be acquired by larger edtech company (PowerSchool, Instructure, etc.)

### 9.4 Specific Action Items for Maia

**Immediate (0-3 months):**

1. **Competitive intelligence** - Deep dive on SchooLinks' customers, features, pricing
2. **Win/loss analysis** - Review RFPs where SchooLinks competed, identify patterns

4. **Pricing model review** - Consider tiered pricing or district discounts

**Long-term (12+ months):**

## 12. CONCLUSION

SchooLinks is a **formidable and rapidly-growing competitor** in the college and career readiness space. With $88.3M in funding (including the largest 2024 US edtech deal at $80M Series B), comprehensive K-12 platform coverage, deep state-specific compliance features, and aggressive pricing ($3.50-$5.51/student), SchooLinks poses a **significant competitive threat** to established players.

**Key Competitive Advantages:**

1. State compliance automation (especially Texas CCMR)
2. K-12 comprehensive coverage (elementary through high school)
3. Work-based learning leadership
4. District-level positioning and sales
5. Competitive pricing (half of Maia's cost)
6. AI innovation (Agentic Layer, Sept 2025)
7. Strong funding and growth trajectory

**For Maia Learning:**

SchooLinks represents a **MEDIUM-HIGH threat** in the US K-12 market, competing directly on price, state compliance, and comprehensive features. However, Maia's international dominance (70+ countries), multilingual capabilities, exceptional counselor experience, and legendary customer service remain strong competitive moats that SchooLinks cannot easily breach.

**Strategic Recommendation:**

Maia should **protect its international stronghold** while **closing feature gaps** in US state compliance, elementary CCR, and work-based learning to remain competitive in US RFPs where SchooLinks is a formidable competitor.
