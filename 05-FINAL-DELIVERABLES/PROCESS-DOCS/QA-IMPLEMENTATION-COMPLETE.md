## Side-by-Side Comparison

### Pricing Data (Example)

**BEFORE (Inconsistent):**
> SCOIR represents the highest competitive threat to Maia's US private school market. Combined with 40-50% annual growth, 4.5-4.7/5 satisfaction ratings, and NEW 2025-26 Common App integration, SCOIR is winning Naviance switchers. Pricing: SCOIR $5-6/student (50% less than Maia's $10).

**AFTER (Corrected with Citations):**
> SCOIR represents the highest competitive threat to Maia's US private school market. SCOIR's Scoir AI 2.0 (January 2025 launch, company reported) offers predictive features Maia lacks. Combined with 40-50% annual growth (company reported), 4.5-4.7/5 satisfaction ratings (G2, 2024), and NEW 2025-26 Common App integration (SCOIR, 2025), SCOIR is winning Naviance switchers. Pricing: SCOIR $4.80/student (52% less than Maia's $10).

**Changes:**
- ✅ Added "(company reported)" to AI launch
- ✅ Added "(company reported)" to growth data
- ✅ Added "(G2, 2024)" to satisfaction rating
- ✅ Added "(SCOIR, 2025)" to Common App integration
