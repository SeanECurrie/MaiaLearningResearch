## Recommendations for Improvement (Minor Enhancements)

### Executive Summary
**Optional Enhancement 1:** Add visual elements
- Consider adding 2-3 key charts (positioning map, investment/return waterfall, threat/opportunity matrix)
- Would enhance scannability for visual learners
- **Priority:** LOW (current text-based format is acceptable for executive summary)

### Full Report
**Optional Enhancement 2:** Expand Common App integration details
- Current report flags "integration depth unknown" (audit needed)
- When audit complete, add section comparing Maia vs. SCOIR NEW 2025-26 integration
- **Priority:** MEDIUM (complete after Common App audit in Q1 2026)

**Optional Enhancement 3:** Add customer case studies
- Include 2-3 anonymized case studies of successful Naviance → competitor switches
- Provides real-world evidence of switching feasibility
- **Priority:** LOW (nice-to-have, not critical)

### Presentation Deck
**Optional Enhancement 4:** Add animated slides notation
- Some complex slides (positioning maps, timelines) benefit from build animations
- Add "(animated: step 1, step 2, step 3)" notes for designer
- **Priority:** LOW (can be determined during design phase)

**Overall:** All enhancements are OPTIONAL. Current deliverables are fully complete and ready for use.

## Data Gaps & Limitations Acknowledged

**Known Limitations (Documented in Appendix D of Full Report):**
1. **Naviance Pricing:** Non-public, estimated $6-8 from secondary sources
2. **Maia Customer Satisfaction:** No published reviews, inferred 4.0-4.5/5 from retention/reputation
3. **SchooLinks Reviews:** Minimal public review data
4. **Xello G2 Reviews:** Only 4 reviews (small sample)

7. **Common App Integration Depths:** Exact API capabilities not publicly disclosed

**Mitigation:**
- All data gaps clearly flagged in documents
- Estimates labeled as "estimated" or "inferred"
- Recommendations include "audit" actions where data gaps exist (e.g., Common App integration audit)

**Quality Impact:** Minimal - data gaps acknowledged, recommendations account for uncertainty
